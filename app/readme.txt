I've worked on the signup and login part only
create 2 classes
RetrofitInterface and LoginResult
then copy the codes from the two also check the LoginPage and the SignUp classes
create a different file in vscode called app.js its the one holding the backend codes make sure your pc has nodejs installled
and mongodb
